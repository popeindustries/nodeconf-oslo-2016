        <p class="note">In 2013, I joined the 3 person strong developer team as a front-end developer and designer</p>
        <p class="note">Much of the code base at that time dated from the last redesign in 2010</p>
        <p class="note step">And it looked something like this: picture a large blob of data wrapped in a layer of XML, with several view layers for rendering mobile pages, desktop pages, app embedded views, svgs, pdfs, and probably a lot more!</p>
        <p class="note">It's a bit unintuitive, but there was actually very little weather related stuff happening in there. Weather data comes from Met, and is mostly indexed by lat/long coordinate, so a large chunk of the application deals with matching a coordinate to a city, ski hill, your street, or any one of ten million places around the world</p>
        <p class="note">This application was reliable, and had proven itself for many years, but obviously, it was going to be difficult to update or change</p>
        <p class="note step">To make things worse, there were very few tests of any kind (it was <em>email-driven-development</em>: users would email errors and regressions they discovered), and there was a two week delay to verify releases</p>
        <p class="note step">Naturally, in our eagerness to "do it right this time", and in our fear of breaking things, we decided to start over</p>
        <p class="note step">The first job was to pull out all the place name data into it's own service. This also made it available for other projects at NRK to consume, and I think the plan is to eventually release it to the public</p>
        <p class="note step">The next step, was to build a REST API and view renderer for the new, responsive layout</p>
        <p class="note">Although this was already a big improvement, and we were now using a CI server to run tests and deploy to the cloud, our workflow for building the UI was really inefficient for such a small team: I was delivering static versions of the front-end markup to my colleague to implement in the back-end, and we ended up duplicating a lot of the work associated with generating HTML strings</p>
        <p class="note step">So after a lot of grumbling on my part, and a skunkworks prototype while our project manager was on summer holiday, we were able to split the API and view renderer into separate projects</p>
        <p class="note step">Now we each had our own monolith</p>

        <p class="note">The easy way at this point would have been to go full-steam ahead with a Single Page App that renders most of the HTML in the browser</p>
        <p class="note step">In 2014, this was relatively common practice, but I don't think it should have ever been considered <em>best</em> practice</p>
        <p class="note step">Server-side rendering is definitely more work if you also plan on rendering things on the client, but it has major advantages:</p>
        <p class="note step">It's cacheable: server generated content can be cached close to your users. This is good for speed, good for sudden traffic spikes, and good insurance against a server meltdown</p>
        <p class="note step">It's resilient: the browser is hostile territory, almost as hostile as the network, and delivering rendered content is good insurance against client-side meltdowns</p>
        <p class="note step">It's accessible: not all devices are created equal (last year we had visits from 11,996 different ones), and server rendering makes it easier to deliver content to as many as possible</p>
        <p class="note step">And it's progressive: delivering a baseline experience to all allows us to add additional features, and improve that experience, for those devices that <em>can</em> handle it. It's also easier to not worry about those that can't</p>
        <p class="note step">Add it all up, and it's <strong>CRAP</strong>! Having to do all this is a real pain in the ass</p>
        <p class="note">Caching is nightmare; worrying about the resiliency of the network and our code is a headache; making content accessible on all those devices is impossible; and building things that can be progressively enhanced is hard</p>
        <p class="note">But let's be honest, most of us love crap: we eat crap, we watch crap, and we spend a lot of time looking at crap on our phones</p>
        <p class="note step">So, do you users a favour, and make things crappier. They'll love you for it</p>

        <p class="note">Once I decided to make things crappier with server-side rendering, I needed to find a way to smooth over the differences between server and client code</p>
        <p class="note step">On the server, you take a URL, use it to route to a logic handler, fetch and munge some data, and render some HTML</p>
        <p class="note">This also seemed like a reasonable abstraction for the client</p>
        <p class="note step">So I wondered: would it be possible to initialize an application...</p>
        <p class="note step">...to add middleware...</p>
        <p class="note step">...to add request parameter validation...</p>
        <p class="note step">...and to handle a request, in the browser, just like Express.js does on the server?</p>
        <p class="note step">Well, it is possible!</p>
        <p class="note step">And not only <em>is</em> it possible, it's a great way to think about program logic:</p>
        <p class="note step">URLs are fantastic for encapsulating state...</p>
        <p class="note step">...anchor tags are great triggers for transitioning between those states...</p>
        <p class="note step">...and Express.js is a simple and elegant way to route state to handling logic</p>
        <p class="note step">As an added bonus, remember that good URLs help make applications <em>extra</em> crappy!</p>

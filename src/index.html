        <p class="note">In 2013, I joined the 3 person strong developer team as a front-end developer and designer</p>
        <p class="note">Much of the code base at that time dated from the last redesign in 2010, though you could still find some code from the original version if you dug deep enough</p>
        <p class="note step">...a giant blob of data lying under a layer of XML, with several view render layers handling requests for mobile pages, desktop pages, app embedded views, svgs, pdfs, and probably a lot more!</p>
        <p class="note">It was a (largely) reliable system that had proven itself over several years...</p>
        <p class="note step">...but it was also very scary to update or change: there were very few tests of any kind (email-driven-development: users would email error reports and regressions), and there was a 2 week delay to verify releases</p>
        <p class="note step">Naturally, in our eagerness to "do things right", we decided to start from scratch...</p>
        <p class="note step">...so the first thing we did was pull out all the place name data into it's own service. This represented some 80% of the existing code base, and was where we made our first serious mistake: it was too difficult to replace the existing implementation in our monolith, so both systems were destined to drift out of sync (though we didn't realize it at the time)</p>
        <p class="note step">The next step was to build a REST API and new view renderer for the markup I was designing</p>
        <p class="note">After spending some time with a workflow that consisted of me sending static markup changes to my colleague to implement, it became clear this just wasn't going work...</p>
        <p class="note step">...so after a lot of prodding, and a skunkworks prototype, we split the API and view renderer into separate projects, and the front-end department became responsible for the render stack</p>
        <p class="note step">now we have 4 monoliths</p>

        <p class="note">Since late 2014 we have been doing the whole thing in JavaScript with Node.js. At that time, it wouldn't have been totally crazy to opt for client-only rendering, but from the very beginning our goal has been to render on the server on first request, with subsequent requests handled directly by the client</p>
        <p class="note">We feel this pattern best matches our content while providing an optimal experience for all our users</p>
        <p class="note">Specifically, it's...</p>
        <p class="note step">...cacheable. Most of the forecast data we get from Met expires hourly, so the cost of that server render can be spread over many requests. It's also...</p>
        <p class="note step">...resilient. The browser is hostile territory, and bad things happen all the time, so being able to show content when things are blowing up is an advantage. And it's...</p>
        <p class="note step">...accessible. Not all devices are created equal (in 2015 we had visits from 11,996 different ones), and server-side rendering allows us to deliver content to as many of them as possible. And lastly, it's...</p>
        <p class="note step">...progressive. Delivering a decent baseline experience allows us to add additional features, and improve that experience, if a device supports it</p>
        <p class="note step">Basically, it's CRAP! It might not be a hip acronym like SPA, AMP, or PWA, but let's be honest, most of us love crap. We eat crap, we watch crap, and we spend a lot of time looking at crap on our phones. But seriously, this model is so CRAP it's awesome</p>
        <p class="note step">As a developer, this universal JavaScript thing is fantastic because it really minimizes the costs associated with context switching, while at the same time giving you full control over your content</p>

        <p class="note">The initial trigger is different, of course (the HTTP pipeline in Node, and the History API in the browser), but the logic abstractions are the same: get an url, route it to a logic handler, munge some data, and render</p>
        <p class="note step">Sometimes we do have to do a little of this...</p>
        <p class="note step">...but overall we are able to share 80% of our code between the two environments</p>
        <p class="note">That's wonderful for us as developers, but it's also CRAP for our users (remembering of course that CRAP is awesome).</p>

        <p class="note step">The desktop version, on the other hand: is heavy on features and content, but also heavy on bandwidth, and not responsive to screen size at all</p>
        <p class="note">Although mobile represented only 1/3 of traffic at that time, it was obvious that Yr needed a better mobile web experience</p>

        <p class="note">In 2013, I joined the team as a front-end developer and designer in order to help build this responsive vision of the future</p>
        <p class="note">At that time, the team was 3 developers strong, and the application looked something like this...</p>
        <p class="note step">...a giant blob of data lying under a layer of XML, with several view render layers handling requests for mobile pages, desktop pages, app embedded views, svgs, pdfs, and probably a lot more!</p>
        <p class="note">It was a (largely) reliable system that had proven itself over several years...</p>
        <p class="note step">...but it was also very scary to update or change: there were very few tests of any kind (email-driven-development: users would email error reports and regressions), and there was a 2 week delay to verify releases</p>
        <p class="note step">Naturally, in our eagerness to "do things right", we decided to start from scratch...</p>
        <p class="note step">...so the first thing we did was pull out all the place name data into it's own service. This represented some 80% of the existing code base, and was where we made our first serious mistake: it was too difficult to replace the existing implementation in our monolith, so both systems were destined to drift out of sync (though we didn't realize it at the time)</p>
        <p class="note step">The next step was to build a REST API and new view renderer for the markup I was designing</p>
        <p class="note">After spending some time with a workflow that consisted of me sending static markup changes to my colleague to implement, it became clear this just wasn't going work...</p>
        <p class="note step">...so after a lot of prodding, and a skunkworks prototype, we split the API and view renderer into separate projects, and the front-end department became responsible for the render stack</p>

        <p class="note">Since late 2014 we have been doing the whole thing in JavaScript with Node.js. At that time, it wouldn't have been totally crazy to opt for client-only rendering, but from the very beginning our goal has been to render on the server on first request, with subsequent requests handled directly by the client</p>
        <p class="note">We feel this pattern best matches our content while providing an optimal experience for all our users</p>
        <p class="note">Specifically, it's...</p>
        <p class="note step">...cacheable. Most of the forecast data we get from Met expires hourly, so the cost of that server render can be spread over many requests. It's also...</p>
        <p class="note step">...resilient. The browser is hostile territory, and bad things happen all the time, so being able to show content when things are blowing up is an advantage. And it's...</p>
        <p class="note step">...accessible. Not all devices are created equal (in 2015 we had visits from 11,996 different ones), and server-side rendering allows us to deliver content to as many of them as possible. And lastly, it's...</p>
        <p class="note step">...progressive. Delivering a decent baseline experience allows us to add additional features, and improve that experience, if a device supports it</p>
        <p class="note step">Basically, it's CRAP! It might not be a hip acronym like SPA, AMP, or PWA, but let's be honest, most of us love crap. We eat crap, we watch crap, and we spend a lot of time looking at crap on our phones. But seriously, this model is so CRAP it's awesome</p>
        <p class="note step">As a developer, this universal JavaScript thing is fantastic because it really minimizes the costs associated with context switching, while at the same time giving you full control over your content</p>

        <p class="note">The initial trigger is different, of course (the HTTP pipeline in Node, and the History API in the browser), but the logic abstractions are the same: get an url, route it to a logic handler, munge some data, and render</p>
        <p class="note step">Sometimes we do have to do a little of this...</p>
        <p class="note step">...but overall we are able to share 80% of our code between the two environments</p>

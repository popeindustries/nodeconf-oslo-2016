    - "it fundamentally changes an equation we've all been working with for years, and an idea can be much more powerful than the technology implementing it"
    - "...the idea of DOM updates being fast ... is important"
    - "The cost of each render remains relatively consistent and is based only on the parts of the page that have changed, so there's little difference between manually re-rendering just the part of the page that has changed and re-rendering the entire page. Those are effectively the same operations"
    - "React has, ironically, allowed us to once again think about writing web applications as a series of pages rather than a monolithic blob of JavaScript code"
    - "it's the same mental model as traditional server-only applications. A page is rendered, some changes are requested, then a page is rendered with those changes"
